      <description>Using R and Python Together
I have previously learned R studio in biostatistics, but the first time I had used Python to code was in computational biology this semester. I was hesitant at first, since I was already comfortable with R, but I quickly warmed up to Python, especially after learning how it can be used in conjunction with R. The two programs can &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to one another through reticulate, which allows Python code chunks to be ran in R markdown files.</description>
